YunoHost specific features
--------------------------

### Multi-users support

This app support LDAP and the SSO authentification.

The restriction is that the user ID in this app is an email adress. So it's potentially possible to have multiple user account with the same username. By example you can have `john@yunohost.org` and `john@seafile.org`. You can see the issue [#5](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/seafile_ynh/issues/5) wich describe this problem. You can check that you are not in this case if by going in seafile admin page in the user tab can see all account.

The best configuration is to give to each user an email which contains the domain used by seafile.

### Supported architectures

Since seafile 6.3 the i386 architecture is no more supported.

Seafile no longer distribute binary for generic armhf architectures but rpi binary could work.

Additional informations
-----------------------

### Change URL

Since now it's possible to change domain or the url of seafile but use it with precaution because it has not been tested enough for a big production installation. For the authentication and user every email for authentication will have the new domain name. For example `toto@old_domain.tld` will be `toto@new_domain.tld`.

To do this run : `yunohost app change-url seafile -d new_domain.tld -p PATH new_path

### Use a special user and put seafile binary in /opt dir :

In the new package version the install is by default in /opt dir, so it section is only usefull for user how as already installed seafile.  

To do this open a console and do this command :

```
# stop seafile server
sudo service seafile-server stop

# Move all data to opt and change user
sudo mv /var/www/seafile /opt/yunohost/seafile
sudo addgroup seafile --system --quiet
sudo adduser seafile --disabled-login --ingroup seafile --system --quiet --shell /bin/bash --home /opt/yunohost/seafile

# Adapt configuration
sudo sed -i "s@user=www-data@user=seafile@g" /etc/init.d/seafile-server 
sudo sed -i "s@seafile_dir=/var/www/seafile@seafile_dir=/opt/yunohost/seafile@g" /etc/init.d/seafile-server
sudo sed -i "s@alias /var/www/seafile/@alias /opt/yunohost/seafile/@g" /etc/nginx/conf.d/$(sudo yunohost app setting seafile domain).d/seafile.conf

# Set the good user for seafile
sudo chown seafile:seafile -R /opt/yunohost/seafile
sudo chown seafile:seafile -R /home/yunohost.app/seafile-data/

# Restart services
